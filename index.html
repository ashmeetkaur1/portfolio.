  <h4>Write about the assignment questions and how you solved differently? </h4>
  <p>First step was to carefully read and understand each question. I made sure to note any specific requirements or constraints mentioned in the instructions. This helped me gain a clear understanding of what was expected from me. I approached the assignment questions with careful analysis, creative thinking, thorough research, and attention to detail, I aimed to provide unique and well-rounded solutions that went beyond mere regurgitation of information.</p>

  <h4>what is the most interesting part in the assignment</h4>
  <p>I enjoy the process of problem-solving and finding innovative solutions. When faced with challenging questions or complex problems, it becomes a stimulating mental exercise to think critically, analyze different angles, and come up with creative approaches to tackle them.</p>
